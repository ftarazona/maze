THE A-MAZE-ING PROJECT!

This repository contains source code and compiling tools for the
 first year Java project of making a maze.

The first goal is to apply the Dijkstra algorithm to such a square
 maze and having some sort of display.
In a second time, file managing will allow to save and load maps.
After this is completed, I am planning to implement a graphical
 interface, and try to make a little game with many maps.
